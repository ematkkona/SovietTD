## 📊 Asset Priority List

### Priority 1: TEST THE GAME FIRST
Before making assets, **play the game with placeholders** to:
- Verify gameplay loop is fun
- Test balance (tower costs, enemy health, wave difficulty)
- Identify what needs visual/audio feedback most

### Priority 2: Core Gameplay Assets (Make These First)
1. **Tower Button Icons** (4 icons, 32x32) - For UI tower selection
   - Without these: Text-only buttons work but are ugly
   - Impact: Medium - UI is functional but unpolished

2. **Basic Sound Effects** (3-5 sounds)
   - `tower_shoot.wav` - Towers shooting
   - `enemy_death.wav` - Enemy defeat
   - `button_click.wav` - UI feedback
   - Impact: High - Makes game feel responsive

3. **Background Music** (1 track, looping)
   - `main_theme.ogg` - Soviet march
   - Impact: Medium - Adds atmosphere

### Priority 3: Visual Polish (Make These Second)
4. **Tower Sprites** (4 sprites, 32x32)
   - Replace colored rectangles
   - Impact: High - Makes game look professional

5. **Enemy Sprites** (4 sprites, 16-24px)
   - Replace colored rectangles
   - Impact: High - Improves visual clarity

6. **Background Image** (1 image, 1920x1080)
   - Simple factory or red square background
   - Impact: Medium - Makes game feel complete

### Priority 4: Juice & Polish (Make These Last)
7. **Effect Sprites** (explosions, muzzle flash)
8. **More Sound Effects** (wave start, coin pickup, etc.)
9. **Voice Lines** (propaganda announcements)
10. **Animations** (walk cycles, shooting effects)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Placeholder Assets Are Actually Good
- Let you focus on **gameplay first, art later**
- Industry standard practice (called "programmer art")
- Easier to change gameplay before committing to final art

### Start Simple
- Use free asset packs to prototype
- Replace with custom art once gameplay is solid
- Don't over-invest in art for untested mechanics

### Audio Can Wait
- Silent games work fine for testing
- Add sound once gameplay loop is proven fun
- Sound design is often last in indie game dev

---

## ✅ Current Status: READY TO PLAY

Your game is **fully functional** without a single asset file!

The colored rectangles and silence are intentional placeholders that allow you to:
- Test gameplay mechanics
- Balance difficulty
- Iterate on design
- Prove the concept works

**When you're ready for visuals/audio, the guides above have everything you need.**

Good luck, Comrade! 🚩
