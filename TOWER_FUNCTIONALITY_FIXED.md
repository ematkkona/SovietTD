# Tower Functionality Fixed! 🏗️

## Problem
Only GuardTower was working properly. Other tower types had issues:
- **PropagandaSpeaker**: Didn't slow enemies
- **BureaucraticOffice**: Didn't deal area damage
- **MissileStation**: Didn't fire missiles

When placing towers during waves, non-GuardTower types appeared but didn't function. BureaucraticOffice was particularly problematic and didn't work even when placed before waves started.

## Root Cause
**Initialization Order Bug!**

All tower scenes inherit from `BaseTower.tscn`, which has `BaseTower.gd` attached. When a child tower (like PropagandaSpeaker) was instantiated:

1. **BaseTower's `_ready()` ran FIRST** with default values:
   - `tower_name = "Base Tower"`
   - `urange = 200.0` (default)
   - `damage = 25` (default)
   - Called `setup_targeting_system()` with these defaults

2. **Child's `_ready()` ran SECOND**:
   - Set custom values like `urange = 180.0`
   - Called `super()` (but parent already ran!)
   - Setup custom timers (propaganda, area damage)

3. **Result**:
   - Targeting system used wrong range values
   - Properties set too late
   - Collision detection may have been misconfigured

## The Fix

### New Initialization Pattern

Changed from direct `_ready()` override to a **virtual method pattern**:

```gdscript
# BaseTower.gd
func _ready():
    initialize_tower()  # ← Call virtual method FIRST
    print("🏗️ ", tower_name, " constructed!")

    setup_tower_components()
    setup_targeting_system()

# Override this in child towers to set stats
func initialize_tower():
    pass
```

### Updated All Tower Scripts

Each tower now overrides `initialize_tower()` to set properties **before** the parent's setup runs:

**GuardTower.gd:**
```gdscript
func initialize_tower():
    tower_name = "Guard Tower"
    tower_cost = 100
    damage = 25
    urange = 200.0
    fire_rate = 1.5

func _ready():
    super()  # Parent setup happens AFTER properties are set

    if sprite:
        sprite.texture = create_placeholder_texture(Color.DARK_GREEN, Vector2(32, 32))
```

**PropagandaSpeaker.gd:**
```gdscript
func initialize_tower():
    tower_name = "Propaganda Speaker"
    tower_cost = 150
    damage = 0
    urange = 180.0  # Now sets BEFORE range area is created!
    fire_rate = 0.5

func _ready():
    super()

    if sprite:
        sprite.texture = create_placeholder_texture(Color.RED, Vector2(32, 32))

    setup_propaganda_system()  # Custom timer setup
```

**BureaucraticOffice.gd:**
```gdscript
func initialize_tower():
    tower_name = "Bureaucratic Office"
    tower_cost = 200
    damage = 15
    urange = 150.0  # Now sets BEFORE range area is created!
    fire_rate = 0.8

func _ready():
    super()

    if sprite:
        sprite.texture = create_placeholder_texture(Color.BROWN, Vector2(32, 32))

    setup_area_damage()  # Custom timer setup
```

**MissileStation.gd:**
```gdscript
func initialize_tower():
    tower_name = "Missile Station"
    tower_cost = 300
    damage = 100
    urange = 250.0  # Now sets BEFORE range area is created!
    fire_rate = 0.5

func _ready():
    super()

    if sprite:
        sprite.texture = create_placeholder_texture(Color.ORANGE_RED, Vector2(40, 40))
```

## How It Works Now

### Initialization Flow

1. **Tower Scene Instantiated**
   ```
   → place_tower() creates tower from .tscn
   → Tower added to scene tree
   → _ready() chain begins
   ```

2. **Child's _ready() Starts**
   ```
   → Calls super() FIRST
   → This triggers BaseTower._ready()
   ```

3. **BaseTower._ready() Runs**
   ```
   → Calls initialize_tower() (child's override)
   → Child sets all properties (name, damage, urange, etc.)
   → Returns to BaseTower._ready()
   → Calls setup_tower_components()
   → Calls setup_targeting_system() with CORRECT urange value ✅
   ```

4. **Back to Child's _ready()**
   ```
   → super() completes
   → Child sets custom sprite color
   → Child sets up custom timers/systems
   → Tower fully initialized ✅
   ```

## Technical Details

### Collision Detection Setup
All towers use the same detection system:
```gdscript
urange_area.collision_layer = 0  # Don't exist on any layer
urange_area.collision_mask = 2   # Detect layer 2 (enemies)
```

Enemies are on layer 2:
```gdscript
# BaseEnemy.gd
collision_layer = 2
collision_mask = 0
```

### Timer-Based Systems

**PropagandaSpeaker:**
- Broadcasts every 2.0 seconds (autostart timer)
- Applies 50% slow for 3.0 seconds
- Stacks with multiple speakers (stronger slow)

**BureaucraticOffice:**
- Ticks based on `fire_rate` (0.8 = 1.25s interval)
- Calculates: `wait_time = 1.0 / fire_rate`
- Deals damage to ALL enemies in range per tick

### Targeting Priority
All projectile towers (Guard, Missile) use "furthest along path" targeting:
```gdscript
func get_first_enemy() -> Node2D:
    var best_enemy = null
    var best_progress = -1.0

    for enemy in enemies_in_range:
        if enemy.has_method("get_path_progress"):
            var progress = enemy.get_path_progress()
            if progress > best_progress:
                best_progress = progress
                best_enemy = enemy

    return best_enemy if best_enemy else enemies_in_range[0]
```

This ensures towers prioritize enemies closest to reaching the end.

## Known Behaviors (Normal)

### Tower Placement
- ✅ Can place towers during active waves
- ✅ Can place towers before waves start
- ✅ All towers work regardless of placement timing

### Tower Costs
- GuardTower: 100₽ (cheapest)
- PropagandaSpeaker: 150₽
- BureaucraticOffice: 200₽
- MissileStation: 300₽ (most expensive)

### Tower Ranges
- BureaucraticOffice: 150.0 (shortest - requires close placement)
- PropagandaSpeaker: 180.0
- GuardTower: 200.0 (default)
- MissileStation: 250.0 (longest - can reach far)

### Area Effect Towers
- PropagandaSpeaker and BureaucraticOffice don't fire projectiles
- They work on ALL enemies in range simultaneously
- Console output confirms they're working even without visuals

## Strategy Tips

1. **Use PropagandaSpeakers Early**
   - Slow effect gives other towers more time to damage
   - Place at path entrance
   - Multiple speakers = stronger slow

2. **BureaucraticOffice for Crowds**
   - Excels when many enemies are bunched together
   - Short range requires strategic placement
   - Continuous damage adds up quickly

3. **MissileStation for Bosses**
   - 100 damage per hit is perfect for high-HP enemies
   - Long range lets you place safely
   - Expensive but worth it for wave 6 CEO (500 HP!)

4. **GuardTower for Coverage**
   - Most cost-effective
   - Good balance of range and fire rate
   - Use multiple for consistent DPS
