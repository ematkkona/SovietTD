# Wave Completion Fixed! 🌊

## Problem
After defeating all enemies in a wave:
- Game "froze" (no new waves could start)
- START WAVE button stayed disabled
- No way to progress to next wave
- Tower placement still worked but seemed broken

## Root Cause
**GameUI was NOT listening for wave completion events!**

The GameUI connected to `WaveManager.wave_started` but not to `EventBus.wave_completed`:
```gdscript
# Before (broken):
func connect_signals():
    WaveManager.wave_started.connect(_on_wave_started)
    # Missing wave_completed connection!
```

This meant:
1. Wave starts → Button disables ✅
2. Wave completes → **Button stays disabled** ❌
3. User can't start next wave

## The Fix

### Updated GameUI.gd
Added connection to wave completion signal:
```gdscript
func connect_signals():
    EconomyManager.rubles_changed.connect(_on_rubles_changed)
    EconomyManager.lives_changed.connect(_on_lives_changed)
    WaveManager.wave_started.connect(_on_wave_started)
    EventBus.wave_completed.connect(_on_wave_completed)  # ← NEW!
```

Added handler to re-enable button:
```gdscript
func _on_wave_completed(wave_number: int):
    update_wave_info()
    print("📊 UI: Wave ", wave_number, " completed, button re-enabled")
```

### Bonus: Enhanced WaveManager Debug Output
Added detailed logging to track wave progress:
```gdscript
func _on_enemy_died(enemy: Node2D):
    enemies_remaining -= 1
    print("💀 Enemy died. Remaining: ", enemies_remaining, " / ", enemies_in_wave)
    _check_wave_completion()

func _check_wave_completion():
    print("🔍 Check wave: remaining=", enemies_remaining, " active=", wave_active)
    if enemies_remaining <= 0 and wave_active:
        wave_active = false
        print("✅ Wave ", current_wave, " completed!")
        EventBus.wave_completed.emit(current_wave)
```

## How It Works Now

### Wave Progression Flow:

1. **User Clicks START WAVE**
   ```
   → WaveManager.start_next_wave()
   → wave_active = true
   → WaveManager.wave_started.emit()
   → GameUI receives signal
   → START WAVE button disabled
   ```

2. **Enemies Spawn and Fight**
   ```
   → Towers shoot enemies
   → Enemy takes damage
   → Enemy dies
   → WaveManager._on_enemy_died()
   → enemies_remaining decrements
   ```

3. **Last Enemy Dies**
   ```
   → enemies_remaining = 0
   → _check_wave_completion() runs
   → wave_active = false
   → EventBus.wave_completed.emit()  ← Key!
   → GameUI receives signal
   → START WAVE button re-enabled ✅
   ```

4. **User Can Start Next Wave**
   ```
   → Button clickable again
   → Click to start wave 2
   → Cycle repeats
   ```

## What You'll See Now

### Console Output (Normal Progression):
```
🚨 Starting wave 1
👔 Spawned Businessman
👔 Spawned Businessman
...
💀 Enemy died. Remaining: 4 / 5
💀 Enemy died. Remaining: 3 / 5
💀 Enemy died. Remaining: 2 / 5
💀 Enemy died. Remaining: 1 / 5
💀 Enemy died. Remaining: 0 / 5
🔍 Check wave: remaining=0 active=true
✅ Wave 1 completed!
📊 UI: Wave 1 completed, button re-enabled
```

### UI Behavior:
- Wave starts → Button greys out (disabled)
- Wave active → Button stays grey
- Last enemy dies → **Button becomes clickable again**
- Click button → Next wave starts

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start Game** (F5)
2. Click **START WAVE**
   - Enemies spawn (blue rectangles)
   - Button becomes grey

3. **Wait or Build Towers**
   - Kill all enemies
   - Watch console for "✅ Wave X completed!"

4. **Button Re-enables**
   - START WAVE button becomes clickable again
   - Wave counter updates: "Wave 1/6" → "Wave 2/6"

5. **Click START WAVE Again**
   - Wave 2 starts
   - More enemies spawn
   - Cycle repeats

## Wave Data Reminder

Your game has 6 waves configured:
- **Wave 1**: 5 Businessmen
- **Wave 2**: 8 Businessmen (faster spawns)
- **Wave 3**: 5 Businessmen + 3 Tourists (mixed)
- **Wave 4**: 10 Tourists (fast enemies)
- **Wave 5**: 6 Businessmen + 6 Tourists (12 enemies!)
- **Wave 6**: 1 CEO Boss (500 HP!)

## Additional Improvements Made

### Debug Logging
All wave events now have detailed console output:
- `💀 Enemy died` - Shows remaining count
- `🏁 Enemy reached end` - When enemy escapes
- `🔍 Check wave` - Wave completion check
- `✅ Wave completed` - Successful completion
- `📊 UI: Wave completed` - UI response

This helps you track exactly what's happening during gameplay.

### Signal Flow
Properly uses EventBus for cross-system communication:
```
WaveManager → EventBus.wave_completed
     ↓
  GameUI (listens and updates)
```

## Known Behaviors (Normal)

### Tower Placement During Waves
- ✅ **You CAN place towers while wave is active**
- This is intentional and normal
- Let's you react to incoming enemies

### Money Calculation
- Kill enemy → Gain rubles immediately
- Place tower → Deduct cost immediately
- Running total displayed in top-left

### Lives System
- Enemies that reach end → Lose 1 life
- Starts with 20 lives
- Game over at 0 lives (not yet implemented)

## Files Modified

1. **`scenes/ui/GameUI.gd`**
   - Added `EventBus.wave_completed` connection
   - Added `_on_wave_completed()` handler
   - Enhanced debug output

2. **`scripts/managers/WaveManager.gd`**
   - Added detailed debug logging
   - No logic changes (was already correct)

## 🎉 Wave System Fully Functional!

You can now play through all 6 waves progressively!

Test it:
1. Press F5
2. Click START WAVE
3. Build towers
4. Watch enemies die
5. See wave complete
6. **Click START WAVE again** ← This now works!
7. Repeat until victory 🚩
