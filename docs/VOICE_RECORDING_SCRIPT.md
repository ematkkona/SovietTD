# Soviet Tower Defense - Voice Recording Script

## üéôÔ∏è Recording Session Guide

**Purpose**: Record comprehensive Russian dialogue for game with multiple variations and character voices.

**Strategy**: Record MORE than needed, curate later. Multiple takes per line. Two different voice actors = more character variety.

**Session Length Estimate**: 45-60 minutes per actor (with breaks)

---

## üìã Recording Instructions

### For the Voice Actor:

**Tone Guide**:
- **Commander/Narrator**: Serious, authoritative, Soviet propaganda style (think WW2 radio announcer)
- **Enthusiastic lines**: Over-the-top patriotic enthusiasm
- **Warning lines**: Urgent but controlled panic
- **Defeat lines**: Somber, disappointed in comrades

**Delivery Tips**:
- Emphasize dramatic pauses
- Roll your R's (very Soviet)
- Imagine you're rallying workers or warning of danger
- Have fun with it - slight comedy is perfect!

### Technical Setup:

**Before Recording**:
- [ ] Quiet room (close windows, turn off fans)
- [ ] Phone on airplane mode OR use proper mic
- [ ] Recording app ready (Voice Memos, Audacity, etc.)
- [ ] Water nearby (stay hydrated between takes)
- [ ] Read through script once before recording

**Recording Format**:
- Each line = separate audio file (easier to edit later)
- Name files clearly: `01_wave_start_v1.wav`, `01_wave_start_v2.wav`, etc.
- Record 2-3 takes per line (pick best later)
- If you mess up, just start that line again (don't stop recording)

## üéØ FILE NAMING CONVENTION

**Suggested Format**: `[number]_[context]_[variation].wav`

**Examples**:
- `01a_wave_start_v1.wav` (First take)
- `01a_wave_start_v2.wav` (Second take)
- `01b_wave_start_v1.wav` (Different line, first take)

- `15a_propaganda_slogan_v1.wav`

**Why this helps**:
- Easy to find specific lines later
- Can compare variations side-by-side
- Alphabetically sorts by context
- Clear which are alternate takes vs. different lines

---

## üí° VOICE DIRECTION TIPS

### For Different Line Types:

**Game State Lines (Urgent)**:
- Imagine you're a radio operator during battle
- Clear, loud, urgent but controlled
- Project voice, don't whisper

**Tower Lines (Approving)**:
- Like a commander praising a soldier
- Warm but still authoritative
- Slight smile in voice

**Combat Lines (Excited)**:
- React like watching a good play in sports
- Quick, punchy delivery
- Energy!

**Propaganda Lines (Bombastic)**:
- Over-the-top, like speaking through megaphone
- Emphasize key words (CAPITALISM, MOTHERLAND)
- Imagine rallying a crowd

**Defeat Lines (Somber)**:
- Disappointed teacher/commander
- Slower pace
- Don't overdo the sadness (still a game)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

‚ùå **Too quiet/mumbling**: Speak clearly, project voice
‚ùå **Too fast**: Leave brief pause before/after each line
‚ùå **Too monotone**: Vary your energy and pitch
‚ùå **Laughing through takes**: If it's funny, record serious take first, THEN do comedy version
‚ùå **Popping P's and B's**: Pull back slightly from mic on plosive sounds

### Secret Weapons:

‚úÖ **Add reverb in post**: Don't worry about sounding "big" - can add echo later
‚úÖ **Do character voices**: Second actor should sound different - experiment!
‚úÖ **Embrace the cheese**: Soviet propaganda IS over-the-top - have fun!
‚úÖ **Take breaks**: Better 3 focused takes than 10 tired ones

## üìù NOTES FOR SECOND RECORDING SESSION

**When recording with second voice actor:**

### Voice Differentiation Strategy:

**Actor 1 (Current Session)**:
- Assign to: Commander narrator, Guard Tower, serious lines
- Voice style: Deeper, authoritative, military

**Actor 2 (Future Session)**:
- Assign to: Propaganda Speaker, enthusiastic lines, flavor
- Voice style: Higher energy, more animated, rally speaker

**Overlap**:
- Record SAME lines with both actors
- Mix and match in-game (Actor 1 for warnings, Actor 2 for victories)
- Create variety (player hears different voice each playthrough)

### Lines to DEFINITELY Re-Record with Actor 2:
- All Propaganda Speaker lines (15a-15f)
- Victory lines (more enthusiastic version)
- Flavor lines (different personality)

---

## ‚úÖ POST-SESSION TODO

After recording session:

1. **Immediate Backup**
   - [ ] Copy all files to 2+ locations
   - [ ] Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox)
   - [ ] External drive

2. **Organization**
   - [ ] Create folder: `~/SovietTD_Assets/audio_raw/session1/`
   - [ ] Rename files with script numbering
   - [ ] Create spreadsheet: Track which takes are best

3. **Quick Quality Check**
   - [ ] Listen to 1-2 takes of each line
   - [ ] Flag any unusable recordings (too quiet, noise, mispronounced)
   - [ ] Note if retakes needed for session 2

4. **Next Steps** (Don't do immediately, save for later)
   - Edit in Audacity (noise reduction, normalize)
   - Export to OGG format
   - Integrate into game

---

## üéâ BONUS: IMPROVISATION PROMPTS

**If your friend is having fun and wants to ad-lib:**

Encourage improvised variations on:
- Generic Soviet slogans (anything patriotic)
- Reactions to capitalism (mockery, disdain)
- Rally cries ("For the Motherland!" type stuff)
- Bureaucratic mumblings (for Bureaucratic Office tower)
- Radio chatter sound-alikes

**Record these as bonus takes** - might be gold for atmospheric background!

---

**Good luck with the recording session, comrade! üéôÔ∏èüö©**

**Remember**: More is better. Worst case you have extra material. Best case you discover amazing takes you didn't expect!
